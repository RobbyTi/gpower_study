13,EZ/RTT,,PMC6923274,No,Humans,,Frontiers in Psychology,2019,2.089,"I conducted a 2 [occupation: masculine (firefighting)/feminine (nursing)] √ó 2 (target gender: female/male) between-subjects experiment. After receiving IRB approval for the project, participants (N = 255) were recruited from the psychology participant pool at a large public university in the northeastern United States, and received course credit for their participation. Sample size was based on an a priori power analysis using G‚àóPower 3 (Faul et al., 2007), with power set at 0.8 and alpha set at 0.05. Because no published studies had examined perceptions of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs crying in different contexts at the time that the research was conducted, I conservatively estimated based on my own past research on gender that effect sizes would fall in the medium-small range, and set effect size at Œ∑p2 = 0.03 (small). The power analysis revealed that a sample size of 256 would be adequate to test the anticipated effects.","Yes, but I've had to make some assumptions.
