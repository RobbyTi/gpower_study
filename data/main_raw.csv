A power analysis in G*Power 3.1 [40] was performed for the research question on the overall effectiveness of InConnection in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. A total sample size of n‚Äâ=‚Äâ138 is sufficient to identify small effects (f‚Äâ=‚Äâ.10) in repeated measures analyses of variance. We estimated the power of the analyses to examine mediation [41] and moderation [42] of intervention effects using R [43]. Our total sample size of n‚Äâ=‚Äâ150 is sufficient to detect mediation in a model with medium correlations (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ.30), and to detect moderation in a model with Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ.25. Analyses to test prediction of intervention effects and to compare youth who nominated a YIM mentor to youth who did not, will be performed using the intervention group only (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ225). For the regression analyses to test prediction of effectiveness, sample sizes of n‚Äâ=‚Äâ52‚Äì65 are required depending on the number of predictors to find a small effect (f2‚Äâ=‚Äâ.20) as demonstrated by power analyses in G*Power 3.1 [40]. A sample of n‚Äâ=‚Äâ228 is required for the t-test comparing youth who found a YIM to youth who did not, to find a medium effect (d‚Äâ=‚Äâ.20). Expectations of effect sizes were based on meta-analyses on the effects of formal [24] and informal [25] mentoring, as well as empirical studies on the effects of YIM in the context of care [27‚Äì29].
 
 If the data show a hierarchical structure and require multilevel analyses, we will perform an interim power analysis while recruitment is still active. To estimate power for multilevel analyses, a large number of factors must be estimated, including the means, variances, and covariances for the explanatory variables, the sample sizes at each level and the variances and covariances for the random effects.

Based on effect size confidence intervals in the small to medium range in a previous meta-analysis of pain appraisal manipulation experiments [3] and effect sizes for associations of threat (r = -.23) and challenge appraisals (r = .21) with pain appraisals in the research on which this study was based [8], a minimum sample N of 228 (76 participants per group) was needed to detect an effect size of .22 at 85% power with an error rate probability of p = 0.05. This estimate was consistent with Kline‚Äôs [29] contention that a sample N of 200 is typically sufficient for causal modeling studies, albeit model complexity is an additional consideration.
