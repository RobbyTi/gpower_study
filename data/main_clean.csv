Level of significance, Œ±‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05;
Type II error (Œ≤) is set at 0.2 with power of the test set at 80%;
According to a previous clinical study using VAS as the main assessment tool for Chuna manual therapy in neck pain patients, the effect size of Chuna manual therapy in comparison to the control can be considered to be 1.03 [30], and 1.49 [31], respectively;
Compliance rate will be set at 85% (the predicted rate of receiving ‚â• 6 sessions of treatment during the five-week treatment period);
For calculation of sample size, G*Power 3.1.7 was used. With evidence from item (3), application of mean‚Äâ¬±‚ÄâSD resulted in conservatively hypothesizing the effect size of this clinical trial as 0.6 because of the high clinical heterogeneity of manual therapies such as Chuna. Application of items (1) and (2) and the effect size resulted in the calculation of a sample size of 90 participants (45 in each group).
The mean comparison of pain requires a total of 90 participants (45 in each group), which is the minimum number of participants needed for testing the abovementioned hypothesis.
