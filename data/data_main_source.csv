A sensitivity power analysis showed that this sample size gave us 80% power to detect a minimum small-to-medium-effect-size difference (η2p = 0.05 or d = 0.44) between network versus the other two conditions, at the 0.05 alpha error probability (two-tailed; Faul et al., 2009).

FUTURE STUDY POWER CALCU.
Finally, our experiment is limited by the size and diversity of the sample. A replication with a larger sample would be ideal to detect the goal model effect on creativity more reliably. With the observed effect size, d = 0.34, this would mean about 268 people for 80% power at the 0.05 alpha error probability (two-tailed; Faul et al., 2009). Although our sample was culturally diverse (e.g., 35% White, 48% Asian), most participants were female (72%) and all were undergraduate students in Canada. Therefore, future work should explore whether the observed effect would generalize to other populations (e.g., people in different countries, of different ages, or in different occupations).

A power analysis in G*Power 3.1 [40] was performed for the research question on the overall effectiveness of InConnection in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. A total sample size of n = 138 is sufficient to identify small effects (f = .10) in repeated measures analyses of variance. We estimated the power of the analyses to examine mediation [41] and moderation [42] of intervention effects using R [43]. Our total sample size of n = 150 is sufficient to detect mediation in a model with medium correlations (r = .30), and to detect moderation in a model with β = .25. Analyses to test prediction of intervention effects and to compare youth who nominated a YIM mentor to youth who did not, will be performed using the intervention group only (n = 225). For the regression analyses to test prediction of effectiveness, sample sizes of n = 52–65 are required depending on the number of predictors to find a small effect (f2 = .20) as demonstrated by power analyses in G*Power 3.1 [40]. A sample of n = 228 is required for the t-test comparing youth who found a YIM to youth who did not, to find a medium effect (d = .20). Expectations of effect sizes were based on meta-analyses on the effects of formal [24] and informal [25] mentoring, as well as empirical studies on the effects of YIM in the context of care [27–29].

If the data show a hierarchical structure and require multilevel analyses, we will perform an interim power analysis while recruitment is still active. To estimate power for multilevel analyses, a large number of factors must be estimated, including the means, variances, and covariances for the explanatory variables, the sample sizes at each level and the variances and covariances for the random effects. These values are notoriously difficult to estimate a priori [44]. Therefore, we will use an internal pilot study design to perform an interim power analysis before closing the recruitment phase to determine whether a sufficient sample size has been obtained or whether the recruitment phase should be extended (within the constraints of our project) [45].
